# Selenium Webdriver + Cucumber + Java

## Project description
Hello,
my name is Bartosz, and this project is about my path in learning programming.
<br>This is an end-to-end automated test project written in Java, covering everything from user creation to placing an order and verifying its status.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
* Java 24 (Oracle OpenJDK)
